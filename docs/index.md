what's a docs? what's a github? what's a thunderredstar?

## what's a github?
github is a sadge website that allows you to host your code and stuff. it's also a social media website, but it's not as good as twitter.

## what's a docs?
they use docs to inundate developers with information. it's a good way to get information to developers, but it's not as good as a wiki.

## what's a thunderredstar?
thunderredstar is a developer who makes a lot of code and stuff. he's also a sadge. oh, and he's also a furry (full dislosure: that's what github copilot said). he's a good developer, but he's not as good as linus torvalds.
